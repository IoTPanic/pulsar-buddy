Hardware TODO



Design
------

[] vias for ground
[] logo in mask/copper

[x] encoder footprint
	[] encoder choice

Circuit
-------


[] power
	[] spec LM7405 replacement?
	[] diode rectifier
	[] diode USB/power safety (see other adafruit boards)
	[x] use resettable?


Later
-----

[] decide if DIN-5 plug or no
	[] if not, spec 3.5mm jack for MIDI
[] MIDI circuit


[] daughter cards
	[] leds?
	[] spec binding posts
	[] pcb mount bananas?
	[] pcb mount 3.5 mm jacks?

[x] standoff sizing
	- 6mm from box to main board
	- 15mm from main board to daughter card
	- 2mm or 4mm from OLED featherwing to cover

	- inter-board connector
		plug: SSW-106-01-?-D    (01 or 02 or 21 or 22 is okay)
		pins: EW-6-09-?-D-xxx   xxx is 255 or less
			? can be any, but T is only tin and least desirable

	[-] 2nd parallel power jack?
		- no real room
