Hardware TODO



Design
------

[] vias for ground
[] logo in mask/copper

[] two-sided components
	[] resistors & diodes that are just copied
	[] transistors that need to be flipped
	[] caps?
	[] fuse
	[] rectifier
	[] power connector needs new package

[] switch standoffs to M3?


Circuit
-------


[] power
	[] diode / solder pad as optiona rectifier replacement
	[] check cap size
	[] do we need the other diode?


Later
-----

[] MIDI circuit
