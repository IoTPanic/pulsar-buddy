Hardware TODO



=== Rev D ===
- the SMD verison


--- ISSUES ----

[ ] Flash not working
[ ] size of post holes
[ ] location of image on box top


[x] USB
	[x] ground the shield? yes!
	[x] distance to edge
		1.45mm says data sheet (57mil)
		currently @ 62.5mil
		- placed exactly

[x] Flash chip
	- original is S25FL116K, now depricated
		http://www.cypress.com/file/196886/download
	- replacement from Cypress is S25FL064L, pin compatible
		S25FL064LABM[FH][IV]01[013]

[x] CPU
	[x] version of CPU & footprint
		SAMD21G18A-A[UF](T?)  -- this is TQFP-48
		SAMD21G18A-M[UF](T?)  -- this is QFN-48
		[-] find a mixed-footprint? some say this is a bad idea
		[x] pick one or the other! QFN
	[x] xtal version and cap sizing
		Ecsxtal ECS-.327-12.5-12-C-TR
			-- the C is 2x tollerance (10ppm)
	[x] remove reset button - it is on the display!

[-] switches to select voltage out?
	- no room unless doing pin only

[x] display
	[x] will it fit over CPU section
		- relayout to move CPU section over?
		- put on headers, changing vertical clearances?
		- will fit over CPU etc... but not over USB
	[x] flip display or slide display over
		- keep flipped, but slid over to clear USB connector

[x] power section
	[x] fuse part & footprint
	[x] power diodes
	[-] jack part in MF - they just don't have it

[x] add part numbers into attributes
	HOUSEPART	(supplied by part)
	MPN
	POPULATE	1/0

	maybe MOUSER and/or DIGIKEY ?
	maybe Manufacturer and Part Number or Manufacturer Part ?

[x] LED power cut pad

[-] power switch?
	- not now - would stick out side, and then unit won't fit in cover




[] misc
	[] wattage needed on resistors as 0603 Rs are less than 1/4W

	[] programming
		[] Pogo pin things or just bare copper?
		[] power/gnd near the pads?
		[] location

		[] programming onto unused pins for OLED headers?


[] trace cleanup
	[-] diff. routing for USB data - good enough!
	[] power no Y
	[] power away from data


=== QUESTIONS ===

	[] vias under the CPU? tented?
	[] layout considerations for regulator?



Ideas
-----

[] MIDI in/out on 3.5mm
[] pin only?
[] clock in/out?
[] break out board for jacks
	[] pin board
	[] banana board
	[] 3.5mm board
[] HW version detection
[] socketed display on std sockets?
