TODO

[] how to stay sync'd to the one?

[x] handle total sync drop gracefully
	- restart as if from scratch
	- display no-sync?
	- sync wildly off?
	- sequence length too short for sync mode
	[x] better withSuspendedQuantum
	[x] why the flash running when perplexed?

[] outputs need to be off when stopped (how?)
[] starting on the 1 should mean all triggers fire on start

[] look into saving when clock goes perplexed



--- Later

[] Figure out production / debug build method
	[] review LOG calls in flash.cpp

[] if no beats after X min... shut down display totally
	- fire back on when beat detected

[] need a UI for "apply right now!"
[] need a UI for "really, reset the whole dang thing!"


[] check and Serial write (or other error) when periods out of range

[] speed up centerNumber by using the fixed size of digits in the font

[] MIDI clock sync mode
	[] timing to 24th
	[] enable / disable event system for sw event on entry/exit

[] make enums be uint8_t based
	- probably not really worth it

	? how to assemble?
	? alternate / better encoder?
	? encoder cap
	? box





QUESTIONS

[] if total reset length is kept under 4 x 4/4 (or even 8 x 8/1!)
	then all cycle counts in q fit in 16 bits

[] should tuplet load be sync'd to measure or full sequence?
[] should sequence length, when reloaded, be reset to first measure?
[] if only a tuplet change, then if sync'd on measure, should sequence restart or no?

[] why doesn't TCC1.WO1 on PAD_SPI_RX (pin 0, PA11) work?



SYNC
----

if computed rate is outside of BPM (divisor) range
	- then BAD_SYNC condition
	- show some form of broken / question icon
	- ? show previous BPM?
		- target is likely to have slewed up?

if missed N (2?) clocks,
	- then PAUSED_SYNC condition
	- show previous BPM, but with a paused icon on top
	- on next clock...
		- restart capture (resetcapture() won't work because same sync rate)
		- ? reset counters to start of sequence?
