TODO

[x] why doesn't number of selectable fields work?

[x] compound select for common settings...
	[x] of meter: 4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 6/8, 12/16
	[x] of tuplets: 2:3, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 7:4, 7:6, 9:8
	[x] draw/select separators (â€” for meter, : for tuplets)


[] speed up centerNumber by using the fixed size of digits in the font

[] field render for BPM
	- sideways
	- select selects from source menu:
		TAP - 1/4 - 1/16 - 24ppb 32ppb 48ppb

[] field render of memories
	- like radio, or does editing save into current selected?
	- select does pick
	- long-select does write
