TODO

[x] why doesn't number of selectable fields work?

[x] compound select for common settings...
	[x] of meter: 4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 6/8, 12/16
	[x] of tuplets: 2:3, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 7:4, 7:6, 9:8
	[x] draw/select separators (â€” for meter, : for tuplets)


[] generate reset pulse
[] generate measure pulse
[] generate tuplet pulse
	? how to handle updates in UI
	-


[] lookup and store qPerBeatUnit when UI changes
	beatUnit and tupletUnit - and as uint32_t



[] speed up centerNumber by using the fixed size of digits in the font

[] field render for BPM
	- sideways
	- select selects from source menu:
		TAP - 1/4 - 1/16 - 24ppb 32ppb 48ppb

[] field render of memories
	- like radio, or does editing save into current selected?
	- select does pick
	- long-select does write
[] save memories to FLASH


[] if no beats after X min... shut down display totally
	- fire back on when beat detected

QUESTIONS

[] if total reset length is kept under 4 x 4/4 (or even 8 x 8/1!)
	then all cycle counts in q fit in 16 bits

[] should BPM be kept in inverted form?
	- for display we want BPM
	- for calcs (see CpuClockDivisor()) we want inverted


================

Changes to settings and timing:

- Sequence Length -

setting:   n x c / u

	measure length (m) = c x q(u)
	total length (t) = n x c x q(u)

	q(1/4 note) = 10080
	q(1/8 note) =  5040
	etc...


state:
	measure (s) in [0..m)
	reset (r) in [0..t)

change n:
	s' = s
	r' = r mod t'

change c or u:
	s' = s mod m'
    r' = (r div m)*m' + s'
